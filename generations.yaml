    description: "The first-generation Toyota Rush was developed as a compact SUV primarily for Asian and some other developing markets, created through a collaboration between Toyota and its subsidiary Daihatsu (which sold its version as the Terios/Be‣go). Featuring a traditional body-on-frame construction unusual for its size class, the Rush combined compact exterior dimensions suitable for crowded urban environments with the raised ride height and rugged characteristics expected of an SUV. Available in both five and seven-seat configurations depending on market, the Rush featured a boxy, upright design with a rear-mounted spare tire emphasizing its SUV identity. Most markets received a 1.5-liter inline-four engine producing approximately 105 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Unusual for its size class, the Rush offered full-time four-wheel drive on some variants, though rear-wheel drive models were more common in many markets. The interior was straightforward and practical, prioritizing durability and ease of use over luxury, with materials and features varying significantly by market. A facelift in 2008 brought revised styling with updated headlights, grille, and interior refinements. This generation found particular success in Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and other markets where its combination of compact dimensions, affordable price, practical design, and SUV capabilities appealed to buyers seeking a versatile family vehicle suited to diverse road conditions."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Rush represents a significant evolution in design and engineering philosophy, transitioning from the body-on-frame construction of its predecessor to a more modern unibody architecture. Developed again in partnership with Daihatsu (which markets its version as the Terios in some regions), the new Rush features more contemporary styling with sharper lines, a large trapezoidal grille, sleek LED headlights on higher trims, and a more integrated rear design that eliminates the externally mounted spare tire. Available in both five and seven-seat configurations depending on market, the Rush grew in size to approximately 4.4 meters in length, enabling improved interior space particularly for third-row passengers in seven-seat variants. Most markets receive a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing approximately 103 horsepower and 136 Nm of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous generation, the second-generation Rush is exclusively offered with rear-wheel drive, focusing on on-road manners and efficiency rather than off-road capability. The interior features a more modern design with improved materials, a touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims, and enhanced convenience features. Safety technology saw significant advancement with standard features including vehicle stability control, hill-start assist, and up to six airbags—unusual in its segment and price point in many developing markets. The second-generation Rush continues to target developing markets primarily in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, South Africa, and Latin America, where it competes in the increasingly important compact SUV segment by offering a balance of styling, practicality, reasonable running costs, and a higher driving position preferred by many consumers in these regions."
