    description: "The first-generation Toyota Rush was launched in January 2006 as a compact SUV developed through Toyota's collaboration with Daihatsu, which sold its version as the Terios (Japan: Be‣go). Built on a built-in ladder frame monocoque body structure, the Rush offered a balance between lighter weight, higher body rigidity, and comfort. Available in both short-wheelbase (J200/J210/J211) and long-wheelbase (F700/F710) configurations, the Rush was sold in five or seven-seat layouts depending on market preference. The design featured a boxy, upright profile with a rear-mounted spare tire emphasizing its SUV identity. Power came from 1.3-liter K3-VE or 1.5-liter 3SZ-VE four-cylinder engines, paired with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. While rear-wheel drive was standard, select markets offered four-wheel drive with a lockable central differential. The Rush received its first facelift in November 2008 with revised bumpers, tail lamps, and improved fuel economy. A second facelift in March 2015 added projector headlamps with LED positioning lamps, LED tail lights, and a wider grille. In Japan, the Rush was exclusive to Toyopet dealerships and was discontinued in March 2016, succeeded by the Rocky/Raize crossover in November 2019. Production continued in other markets until 2017, with strong sales in Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and various developing markets."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Rush was unveiled alongside the Daihatsu Terios in Indonesia on 23 November 2017, with sales commencing on 3 January 2018. Unlike its predecessor, this generation is offered exclusively in long-wheelbase configuration with no short-wheelbase or four-wheel drive options. The design transitioned to a more crossover-like appearance with streamlined styling influenced by the FT Concept, featuring a rear liftgate instead of the traditional side-opening door and eliminating the externally mounted spare tire. Model codes are F800 for the international market Rush/Terios and F850 for the Malaysian market version. Power comes from a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing approximately 103 horsepower and 136 Nm of torque, paired with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions, with rear-wheel drive the sole configuration. The interior features modern styling with improved materials and a touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims. Safety features include vehicle stability control, hill-start assist, and up to six airbags. In Indonesia, grades include X, R, and TRD Sportivo (later renamed GR Sport in August 2021). A facelift was launched in June 2023 with updated styling. The Rush continues to target Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, South African, and Latin American markets where it competes in the compact SUV segment."
